1. COVID-19 Case-Based Surveillance: Enrolling and tracking suspected cases
2. Contact Registration: Strengthening active COVID-19 case detection through contact tracing activities such as identification
3. Ports of Entry Screening: Enrolling travellers who have visited COVID-19-high-risk locations for 14-day monitoring and followup
4. COVID-19 Surveillance Event: A simplified list that captures minimum necessary data points for daily or weekly reporting
5. COVID-19 Aggregate Surveillance: A reporting dataset that captures minimum necessary data points for daily or weekly reporting
